# Nebula Browser

A **Discord-inspired test client** for [**nebula-gateway**](https://github.com/jeff-ironsight/nebula-gateway) built with **Vite** and **Vue 3**.

Nebula Browser focuses on exercising the gateway protocol:

- Auth0 login
- WebSocket identify and channel subscribe
- Message create and dispatch handling
- Minimal UI to validate gateway behavior

This project is intentionally **client-first** and designed as a lightweight harness for validating gateway changes.
